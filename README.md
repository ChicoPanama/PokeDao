# üÉè PokeDAO

PokeDAO is an intelligent trading assistant for collectible cards.  
It is built to be the Bloomberg Terminal of Pok√©mon cards: a single platform where collectors and investors can discover new listings, understand true market value, and make informed decisions quickly.

## üåç What Is PokeDAO?

PokeDAO unifies scattered card market data into one streamlined experience.  
Instead of checking multiple sites, users receive a real-time feed of listings combined with clear valuations and insights.  

The platform highlights opportunities the moment they appear, explains the context behind each card, and provides simple calls to action such as **Buy**, **Watch**, or **Avoid**. Whether through the Telegram bot or the web dashboard, PokeDAO makes it easier for collectors and investors to stay ahead of the market.

## ‚ö° What Powers It

At its core, PokeDAO is powered by a continuous data pipeline and intelligent analysis. Scrapers collect and normalize card information from sources like Collector Crypt, with plans to expand to eBay, PSA, and TCGPlayer. This data flows into an analysis layer that identifies rarity, compares pricing trends, and evaluates potential growth.  

The Telegram bot delivers instant alerts when new cards appear, while the dashboard provides a deeper view into listings, watchlists, and historical pricing. Behind the scenes, the system is supported by a modern stack including Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Docker for reliability and scale.

## ‚ú® Why PokeDAO?

PokeDAO brings speed by delivering alerts the moment cards are listed.  
It adds clarity through transparent, data-driven valuations.  
And it provides confidence by helping collectors and investors act with information they can trust.
