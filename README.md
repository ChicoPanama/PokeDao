# PokeDAO
Pokémon DAO is an AI-powered collectibles fund built around a community token launched on Pump.fun, where all trading volume flow into a secure multisig vault used to acquire high-value Pokémon cards. The project’s centerpiece is a Telegram Alert Bot that continuously ingests raw marketplace data (starting with Collector Crypt), normalizes listings, compares them against fair-value benchmarks (PriceCharting, eBay, PSA APR), and uses machine learning to generate a “Best Investment Thesis” for each new listing. The bot delivers real-time alerts with clear buy signals, gated by DAO token access, while the vault curator executes purchases based on AI-backed recommendations. This creates a transparent, data-driven loop where trading activity grows the vault, AI optimizes acquisitions, and the bot serves as the main hub for community engagement and actionable investment intelligence.
