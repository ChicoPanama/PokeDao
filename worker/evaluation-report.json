      "investmentTier": "High-value",
      "evaluationScore": 8,
      "fairValueEstimate": 1200,
      "investmentThesis": "This is a strong investment due to its extreme rarity as a Japanese Base Set BGS 10 Black Label, the highest possible grade, combined with the card's historical significance and the fact that Kadabra was removed from later prints, adding unique collectibility. However, the high current price limits short-term upside potential.",
      "riskFactors": [
        "Market correction in high-end collectibles reducing demand",
        "Potential oversaturation if more high-grade copies surface",
        "Liquidity risk due to niche buyer pool for premium-graded Japanese cards"
      ],
      "opportunities": [
        "Continued appreciation driven by scarcity of Black Label 10s and vintage Japanese sets",
        "Increased demand from Japanese market collectors and investors",
        "Potential for Kadabra's cultural and historical significance to drive further interest"

      "investmentThesis": "This is a premium investment-grade card featuring Mewtwo, one of Pok√©mon's most iconic characters, in a Japanese-exclusive BGS 10 Black Label - the highest possible grade. The combination of character popularity, perfect condition certification, and limited Japanese print run creates strong long-term appreciation potential.",
      "riskFactors": [
        "Premium pricing leaves limited short-term upside",
        "Black Label premium could compress if grading standards change",
        "Japanese market cards can have lower liquidity in Western markets"

      "opportunities": [
        "Mewtwo remains perpetually popular with collectors and players",
