# 🛠️ GITHUB ACTIONS WORKFLOW FIX REPORT

## ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED: YAML Syntax Error

### 🐛 Original Problem
```
Error: Expected a scalar value, a sequence, or a mapping
Location: /Users/arcadio/dev/pokedao/.github/workflows/ci.yml:2:2
```

### 🔧 Root Cause
The YAML file was missing proper spacing between the `name` and `on` sections, which caused a parsing error. YAML requires clear separation between top-level keys.

### ✨ Solution Applied
**Before:**
```yaml
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
```

**After:**
```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
```

### 📋 Complete Fixed Workflow
```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v3
        with:
          version: 9
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: pnpm
      - run: pnpm install
      - run: pnpm --filter api prisma generate
      - run: pnpm -w typecheck
      - run: pnpm -w build
```
