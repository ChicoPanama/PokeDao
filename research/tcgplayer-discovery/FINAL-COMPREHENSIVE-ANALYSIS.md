## **🔍 ABOUT THE 50,000 NUMBER:**

The analysis shows we currently have **1,195 Phygitals cards**, not 50,000. The 50K number may have referred to:

1. **Projected total** if all marketplace categories were harvested
2. **Combined records** across all tables (cards + sales + users + sets = 2,958)
3. **A different marketplace or API endpoint**
4. **Transaction volume or blockchain data** rather than unique cards

### **🚀 NEXT STEPS TO REACH 50K:**
If there really are 50K+ cards available on Phygitals, we could:
1. **Enhanced API Discovery**: Find additional Phygitals endpoints
2. **Category Expansion**: Include non-Pokemon cards (Yu-Gi-Oh, MTG, etc.)
3. **Historical Data**: Capture sold/delisted items
4. **Multi-Chain Support**: Explore other blockchain marketplaces
